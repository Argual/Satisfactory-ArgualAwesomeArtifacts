### General info  

Adds Somersloop and Mercer Sphere as a purchasable part in the AWESOME shop.

Price of one Somersloop is 50 coupons.
Price of one Mercer Sphere is 20 coupons,

### Intent  

I wanted to reward sinking large amounts of items with something that can be beneficial in the long run gameplay-wise other than statues and decoration. I would classify this mod as a cheat mod, since technically you can reach Somersloop-only power generation with purchaseable Somersloops, but that is why the price is so high.
